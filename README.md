# Data-sets
Different Data-set on various Important & Interesting topic
These Datasets are classic and best to Implement to learn Machine Learning Algorithms.
Will Add more Datasets in future for Developers, Data Scientist, Students and begineer's.
From this Dataset, Students will develop & Learn-
1. Data Visualization
2. Data Science
3. Data Analytics
4. Prediction in ML
5. Accuracy In Model Formation
6. Result through Training & Testing the Data
7. Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

Here are many of the links mentioned so far:
